   About this file
   
   I am thinking of transferring messages and commands into XML files so they
   can be edited with the Forge Editor in the future. However this will put
   away for now. 
   
   The directory "enUS" hints my intention for possible localization. However,
   /I do not plan on translating the game myself/. I will focus and release it
   in English, but I don't want to turn down potential creativity by hard-coding
   things into the engine.
